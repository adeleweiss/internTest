# InternShip Test For Fetch

This is the submission for Adele Weiss. "spendPoints.java" is the main file. To execute the program,
either use "make run" which will run the program with the CLAs "5000" and "transactions.csv". To run
the program with other inputs, first compile the program:

javac spendPoints.java

then execute with:

java spendPoints.java {Points} {File name, or path to file relative to directory}

this should return a print statement with the list of payers and their updated points.
